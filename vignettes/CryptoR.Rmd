### API Connection

Let's first check the API connection to CoinGecko using `cg_get_ping()`.  

This should return: (screenshot)

<br>

```{r }
cg_get_ping()
```

With a verified connection we can answer some questions.


### (1) What's the broad crypto market like?

We can request a snapshot of the cryptocurrency market via `cg_get_global()`:

```{r }
global <- cg_get_global()
dateTime <- lubridate::now("UTC")
```

The object called `global` contains: (screenshot)

Let's do a quick plot of the `market_cap_percentage` - it will be the top
10 cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization percentage.

```{r }
# pull out the data
mcp1 <- tibble::as_tibble(global$data$market_cap_percentage)
mcp1 <- tidyr::pivot_longer(mcp1, everything(), names_to="symbol", 
                            values_to="perc")

# build the plot
ggplot2::ggplot(mcp1, ggplot2::aes(x=reorder(symbol, -perc), y=perc) ) +
  ggplot2::geom_col() +
  ggplot2::labs(title=paste0("Top 10 by Market Cap % as of ", 
                             dateTime, " UTC"), x="")
# format percentage sum
topTenPerc <- round( sum(mcp1$perc), 2)
```

We see that the **top 10** cryptocurrencies account for **`r topTenPerc`** % of the crypto market.


### (2) How is the market capitalization distributed?

```{r }
activeCurrencies <- global$data$active_cryptocurrencies
```

CoinGecko tracks a lot of cryptocurrencies: **`r activeCurrencies` coins** in total. We can call the function `cg_get_coins_markets(...)` to get supported coins price, market capitalization, volume, and market related data - over 20 data points.

There are 8 parameters and CoinGecko in this instance puts a request limit
to 1 page with a maximum of 250 coins or symbols on the page.

`cg_get_coins_markets(...)` (screenshot)

![global](cg_get_coins_markets.png)

<br>

We will not request the data for all currencies - just the **first 1000** 
symbols. We'll have to use a custom function - `cg_coins_df(...)` - it's basically a wrapper for `cg_get_coins_markets(...)`. The function `cg_coins_df(...)` uses a loop to build a custom sized data frame.

```{r }
customDF <- cg_coins_df(per_page = 250, pages = 4)
```

A quick glimpse will see if we received 1000 ordered symbols and also
which variable names are available for analysis.

```{r }
dplyr::glimpse(customDF)
```
Let's look at the five-number summary for market cap in millions of dollars.

```{r }
summary(customDF$market_cap / 10^6)
```
We can see that the data is heavily skewed. Most people may realize that the
market is dominated by a few names. So, we will log transform in order
to see a clearer boxplot - again in millions of dollars.

```{r }
# plot building
ggplot2::ggplot(customDF, ggplot2::aes(x=market_cap / 10^6) ) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot() +
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +
  ggplot2::theme(axis.title.x=ggplot2::element_blank(),
                 axis.text.y=ggplot2::element_blank(),
                 axis.ticks.y=ggplot2::element_blank()) +
  ggplot2::labs(title=paste0("Market Cap Distro in Millions as of ",
                             dateTime, " UTC") )
```

### (3) What about individual coin performance?

Our custom data frame `customDF` includes a variable called `sparkline_in_7d` 
which provides 7 days of hourly price information or 168 data points. For 
example, a 7-day sparkline looks like this:

```{r }
# pull out the sparkline data
coin <- dplyr::filter(customDF, name == "Bitcoin")
sparkLine <- tibble::tibble( price = unlist(coin$sparkline_in_7d) )
sparkLine <- tibble::rowid_to_column(sparkLine, "hours")

# build the plot
ggplot2::ggplot(sparkLine, ggplot2::aes(x=hours, y=price ) ) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::theme_classic() +
  ggplot2::labs(title=paste0(coin$name, " 7-day Chart as of ",
                             dateTime, " UTC") )
```


The `sparkline_in_7d` variable allows us to do some unique charting and 
analysis. We can create a **linear model for each symbol** and then extract 
the slope to give us a rough idea of the 7-day trend.  

First we need to check for valid `sparkline_in_7d` data. CoinGecko can at
times return `numeric(0)` for a symbol which is specifically annoying. We'll 
also check whether a symbol has enough data points; in this case a 
minimum of 6 days of hourly data.

```{r }
# function def
sparkLen <- function(df){
  return( length(unlist(df$sparkline_in_7d)) )
}

# filter columns and check sparkline data
coins <- dplyr::select(customDF, c(name,sparkline_in_7d) )
coins <- dplyr::mutate(coins, len = apply(coins, 1, sparkLen) )
coins <- dplyr::filter(coins, len > 24*6)
lenMod <- nrow(coins)
```

After filtering the symbol count is now **`r lenMod`**.

We can now use `apply` on each row of the tibble and send data to the 
`price_model()` function for model creation and slope extraction.

```{r }
# function def and returning just the slope
price_model <- function(df){
  sparkLine <- tibble::tibble( price = unlist(df$sparkline_in_7d) )
  sparkLine <- tibble::rowid_to_column(sparkLine, "hours")
  fit <- lm( price ~ hours, data = sparkLine )
  return(fit$coefficients[2])
}

# for each data frame row, get the sparkline's lm model
coins <- dplyr::mutate(coins, slope = apply( coins, 1, price_model ) )
```

Let's look at some of the extracted slope data.

```{r }
head(coins[-2:-3] )
```

We can now plot the slopes on a single chart starting from a common point - 
intercept at 0 (zero).

```{r }
# for the chart's y-axis boundaries
avg <- mean(coins$slope)
stdDev <- sd(coins$slope)
upperY <- avg+stdDev*2
lowerY <- avg-stdDev*2

slopeGraph <- ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::xlim(0, 7) + 
  ggplot2::ylim(lowerY, upperY) +
  ggplot2::geom_abline( intercept = 0, slope = coins$slope,
                        linetype = "dotted",
                        color = ifelse(coins$slope<0,"red","chartreuse2") )

# finalize the graph's presentation
posNums <- sum( coins$slope > 0 )
negNums <- sum( coins$slope < 0 )
slopeGraph <- slopeGraph +
  ggplot2::annotate(geom="text", x=6, y=upperY*.75, label=posNums,
                    color="black") +
  ggplot2::annotate(geom="text", x=6, y=lowerY*.75, label=negNums, 
                    color="black") +
  ggplot2::ggtitle( paste0("Absolute Coin Performance as of ",
                           dateTime, " UTC") )

# display it
slopeGraph
```

The graph shows how many coins are up or down on the weekly trend using the
`lm` or linear model function.

Let's get the names of the top and bottom 10 cryptocurrencies for the 
past week.

```{r }
topPerform <- dplyr::slice_max(coins[-2], n=10, order_by=slope)
worstPerform <- dplyr::slice_min(coins[-2], n=10, order_by=slope)
```

The top performers:

```{r }
topPerform
```

and the worst performers:

```{r }
dplyr::arrange(worstPerform, desc(-slope) )
```

### (4) What's the overall crypto market pulse?

The previous discussion was about absolute performance of individual coins.
Here we'll consider the relative performance.

Again, we'll use the coins' or symbols' slope measurement but weigh it 
**by market capitalization.** We can then get a sense of the 
market cap weighted direction of the coins.

```{r }
# pull out "market cap" data and add it to another using join
marketCapDf <- dplyr::select(customDF, name, market_cap)
coinsWeighting <- dplyr::left_join(coins, marketCapDf, by = "name")

# calculate the slope weighting
marketCapSum <- sum(coinsWeighting$market_cap)
coinsWeighting <- dplyr::mutate(coinsWeighting,
                  slopeWeighted = (market_cap/marketCapSum)*slope )

# the market's overall weighted slope
slopeAll <- sum(coinsWeighting$slopeWeighted)

# what follows - just like above for slopeGraph
# maybe a separate function is better but for now...

# y-axis limits
avg <- mean(coinsWeighting$slopeWeighted)
stdDev <- sd(coinsWeighting$slopeWeighted)
upperY <- avg+stdDev*2
lowerY <- avg-stdDev*2

slopeGraph2 <- ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::xlim(0, 7) + 
  ggplot2::ylim(lowerY, upperY) +
  ggplot2::geom_abline( intercept = 0, slope = coinsWeighting$slope,
                  linetype = "dotted",
                  color = ifelse(coinsWeighting$slope<0,"red","chartreuse2") )

# prettify the graph
posNums <- sum( coinsWeighting$slopeWeighted > 0 )
negNums <- sum( coinsWeighting$slopeWeighted < 0 )
slopeGraph2 <- slopeGraph2 +
  ggplot2::annotate(geom="text", x=6, y=upperY*.75, label=posNums,
                    color="black") +
  ggplot2::annotate(geom="text", x=6, y=lowerY*.75, label=negNums, 
                    color="black") +
  ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0("Relative Coin Performance as of ",
                          dateTime, " UTC") )

# add the overall market slope
slopeGraph2 <- slopeGraph2 + 
  ggplot2::geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = slopeAll, size = 1,
                         linetype = "dashed", color="black")

# display it
slopeGraph2
```

The **dashed black line** gives the market cap weighted 
direction of the overall market - or in this case, considering the top 
`r lenMod` cryptos. Slope value equals **`r slopeAll`**.

Lastly, let's look at the 10 cryptocurrencies whose 
**slopes by weighted market cap** are affecting the market the 
greatest. This could be **upwards or downwards** pressure! 
Here we'll just look at the absolute values of weighted slopes.

The top 10 are:

```{r }
coinsWeighting <- dplyr::mutate(coinsWeighting, absVal = abs(slopeWeighted) )
coinsWeighting <- dplyr::arrange(coinsWeighting, by=-absVal)
dplyr::slice_max(coinsWeighting[-2:-6], n=10, order_by=absVal)
```

### Closing

This was a brief introduction into some cyrpto market analysis using the
CryptoR package.

The CoinGecko API exposes much more than what has been implemented here.

But the previously created data frame `customDF` pulls in plenty of data from 
which further charting, exploring, and analysis can be done.
